	<!-- create a paragraph -->
	<p>Max grew up in beautiful New Jersey, and had a generally
		unremarkable childhood. After attending college in Maine
	and majoring in Psychology, Max was a middle school math teacher
		in Brooklyn for two years. Hoping to work on similar issues of
		inequity in cities, Max began a career in urban planning in the
		Bay Area. Max worked for the City of Berkeley and an affordable housing think tank in San Francisco.
		Max is currently working towards a Master of City Planning degree at MIT. In his free time, Max enjoys cooking spicy food, hiking, and listening to music.</p>

	<p>A visualization that Max finds particularly inspiring is the <a href='http://hint.fm/wind/index.html'>Wind Map</a>, created by Hint.FM using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
